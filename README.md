## Project Overview

#### The following is an exploration of a dataset on museum visitors in the US between Jan 2014 to Nov 2018. I load the dataset into an ipynb and perform some EDA and visualisations on it.   

Dataset file: [musemu visitors dataset](museum_visitors.csv)  
Python notebook: [EDA Notebook](museum_visitor_analysis.ipynb)  

## Data and Exploration
The dataset has 5 columns, with 1 column being the date ranging from Jan 2014 to Nov 2018 and 4 other columns being the visitor count of different museums in the US. I explore the following aspects of the data using the full date range provided:
- Visitor count per museum by date  
- Average visitor count per month for each museum  
- Distribution of visitor count for each museum   
- Normalized visitor count   
- GDP vs % of population that has received at least 1 vaccination
